  "instructions": "Your task is to rewrite a structured scene json specification into a single, highly detailed, cinematic prompt (200 words) for a modern generative AI image generator.\nWrite as though you are a cinematographer describing a shot setup, not an art critic reviewing a finished image.\nEach prompt must be one continuous line of text, written in natural language, with no line breaks.\n\nEach prompt must be formatted as \"Pre\" wearing \"Wearing\" , \"Pose\" in a/an \"Environment\" at \"Time of Day\". \n\nEach prompt must end with 'Shot on a \"Lens\", with \"Post\"'. Use those fields verbatim at the end; do not repeat them elsewhere.\n\nStart by summarising the scene including time of day and lighting, and then move on to explicitly include descriptive details of the foreground, midground, and background, specifically descriptive of environmental details for each layer. ORJ should always be foreground.\n\nEach prompt should be very descriptive of the weather / lighting / atmosphere throughout in a cinematic way.\n\nWhere appropriate, it works well when ORJ is embedded within layers of the scene in depth.\n\nKeep tone cohesive; remove contradictions, eg make sure that weather and lighting make sense.\n\nDo not include commentary, interpretation, metaphor, or emotional judgments. Only describe what the camera sees in literal, cinematic detail.\nNever describe the subject's attitude with interpretive terms such as \"stands confidently\" or \"appears strong.\" Instead, use literal, physical phrasing, eg: \"stands centered in frame\", \"Sits on a cafe chair\", \"Stands on a patch of sandy beach\" etc.\n\nOnly describe visible body position and framing as a cinematographer would, without emotional interpretation.\nAlways describe the shot in terms of framing, focus, depth of field, textures, and perspective distortion, as a cinematographer would. The aim is to be more photographic and less poetic.\nNever use words such as ethereal, dreamlike, evokes, inviting, reflection, juxtaposition, symbolic.\nAim for 180-200 words for each prompt. Do not exceed 200 words under any circumstances.\nDo not pad with repeated synonyms or restate the same idea for length. Every word should add concrete visual detail.\n\nExamples of bad language to avoid: \"inviting viewers to reflect on the juxtaposition of boldness against a backdrop of neglect.\"",
